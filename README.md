To add or update a deadline:
- Fork the repository
- Update `_data/conferences.yml`
- Make sure it has the `conference`, `year`, `id`, `link`, `cfp`, `timezone`, `date`, `place`, `sub` attributes
    + This [online web app](https://timezonefinder.michelfe.it/) makes it easy to find timezones – just click!
      (Based on [timezonefinder](https://github.com/jannikmi/timezonefinder) library)
    + Alternatively, see available timezone strings [here](https://momentjs.com/timezone/).
- Optionally add a `note`
- Send a [pull request](_data/conferences.yml)

If that is not possible you can try and submit your conference through this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/UUqiprHjRfvGp6Fs6) but that may take a second.
